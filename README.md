==========

my vim, tmux, xdefaults and fluxbox configuration files, also some scripts i use.

Mostly for easy installation in other computers.

The plugins in my vim are what i have considered helpfull to have. They are with the pathogen manager and are also submodules,
so for updating them you can go to .vim/bundle and do: git submodule foreach git pull origin master. For installing new ones 
git submodule add https://github.com/example/example.git example in bundle. If you know of another good plugins that
could be added or any improvements, fixes, you are welcome.
